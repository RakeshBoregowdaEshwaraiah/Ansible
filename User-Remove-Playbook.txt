- hosts: webservers
  become: true
  tasks:
  - name: Remove User
    user:
    name=niranjan state=absent remove=yes force=yes
==================================================
In the above playbook, remove=yes will remove the home directory and force=yes will remove the files in the directory.

Remove user. 
Removing a user is very easy and it will need the state to be set to absent. 
This is equivalent to the userdel command in Linux.
